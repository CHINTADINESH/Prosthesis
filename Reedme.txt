Problem Statement:
Classification problem

rawData used:       data from biopatrec-Data_Repository is downloaded from https://github.com/biopatrec/biopatrec/tree/Data_Repository




labels=             ['Open Hand', 'Close Hand', 'Flex Hand', 'Extend Hand', 'Pronation', 'Supination', 'Side Grip', 'Fine Grip', 'Agree', 'Pointer']


classifier :        simple feed forward neural network


input:              rough entrophy, corelation between two channels, zero crossings

Network structure : input->14,hidden->28,output->10
                    loss function :categorical cross entropy
                    activation : relu and sigmod respectively
                    10-fold cross validation


output:             class label


results:            find the results in the file 'initial_mlp_results.csv'

not attempted:    denoising the raw signal,
                  network not optimized for time and space complexity
                  other attributes are not tested
                  we can play around with no of neurons in hidden layers and extent of training
